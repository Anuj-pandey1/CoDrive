## Description: CoDrive is a ride-sharing platform that aims to connect riders who are traveling from one destination to another with poolers who are looking for a ride in the same direction. The platform allows users to create a profile, search for rides, and book a seat with a driver who is heading in the same direction as them.
CoDrive aims to solve several problems for road travelers, such as reducing travel costs, reducing traffic congestion, and lowering carbon emissions. By sharing a ride with others, users can split the cost of fuel and tolls, reducing the overall cost of travel. Additionally, by reducing the number of cars on the road, CoDrive aims to reduce traffic congestion, making travel faster and more efficient. Finally, by sharing a ride, CoDrive hopes to reduce the carbon emissions associated with travel, promoting a more sustainable mode of transportation.

## Overview
1. Login using JWT
2. Users will be able to add friends and request nearby riding friends to share their rides
3. Riders will be given option to accept request made by pooler.

## Features
1.
> User and Riders need to provide their current location and destination
   Pooler source = A , Pooler destination = B, Rider source = C, Rider destination = D
> For both riders and poolers, the distance between their source and destination is calculated
> Both the distances are compared, the rider is informed about the buffer distance and is accordingly made request to accept pooler

## Future goals
1.
> If a user travels from A to B with his car and another user wants to travel 
> from C to D which lies in between A and B at different times then our app would suggest a dedicated time 
> to each user to start their journey so that they can reach their destination in the best possible way.
2.
> 
> If a group of people have same destination but different starting point and have different type of vehicles 
> then the algorithm of our app will suggest which person should drive with their vehicle and which should do carpool so that 
> they can reach their destination with most efficient fuel cost.
